Consider a possible world where everyone speaks the same language. What sorts of benefits would society derive from a means of freely communicating with anyone anywhere?

Esperanto is a constructed language which was developed by a Russian guy with the purpose of being an easy language to learn and develop, and promoting a common form of communication across the world.





draft outline:


topic:
- sci-fi thought experiment about a single-language world, Esperanto declared the universal language

benefits:
- improved communication across the world, less time spent translating, more congruity of thought
- only one language to learn, making it easier for the educational system and freeing up time to focus on other things

negatives:
- cultural uniformity will progress more quickly (I mean, we'll eventually have collective consiousness anyway...), since much of societal culture evolves in tandem with its language
- learning a new language is fun, and that won't be possible anymore unless new languages are allowed to be created
- thought control, is this a new version of 1984?

questions:
- will cultures still maintain independent qualities?
- will creating new languages be illegal?
- will idioms be illegal?
- who controls the development of the language, what form of collaboration is allowed?
