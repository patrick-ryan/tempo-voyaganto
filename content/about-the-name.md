I learned today that you can create domain names using special characters from other languages (e.g. diacritics) - but I already bought this domain haha

"Tempo vojaganto" appears to translate to "time trainer", but I was really going for "time traveler" which is "tempo vojaƒùanto"

Close enough

That spells the end of this post, thanks for reading
